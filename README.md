Apply KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm) in Machine Learning (ML)
The main objective of this project is to create a system that identifies the nearest emergency response unit (police, fire department, ambulance) based on information received from mobile phones used in emergency calls. 
This system will help reduce emergency response time and provide more effective assistance.
